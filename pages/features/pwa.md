# PWA

MDMT supports PWA by default.
It works on offline by precaching all assets.

`npm run build` will generate following files for PWA:

- `static/manifest.json`: PWA settings
- `docs/sw.js`: ServiceWorker script generated by [Workbox](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/workbox/)

MDMT registers `sw.js` to the browser in `components/ServiceWorker.tsx`.
You can change loading processes by editing the file.
