# FAQ

## Can I set page titles from Markdown headings automatically?

MDMT doesn't support it because it's actually a difficult problem.
I didn't wanna think about delimiters, suffix, etc in all usecases.

If you think your usecase is simple enough, you can do that, I think.

## Why no CLI tools?

I don't need it...
Even if CLI tools were provided you would wrap them with npm scripts, wouldn't you?

## Why no XXX?
